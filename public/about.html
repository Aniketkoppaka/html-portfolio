<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Aniket, a 19-year-old male living in Jaipur, India. I’m currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science 
  and Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. My academic journey is 
  important to me, and I’m always looking to expand my knowledge and skills in the tech field.</p>

<p>In addition to my studies, I have a strong passion for fitness. Going to the gym is an essential part of my routine,
  as I believe in staying physically active and working hard to achieve my fitness goals. It’s a great way for me to
  clear my mind, stay motivated, and build resilience both physically and mentally.</p>

<p>I firmly believe in putting in the effort to reach my goals, whether they are academic, personal, or fitness-related.
  I always try to maintain focus, stay disciplined, and embrace challenges along the way. My drive and determination keep
  me motivated to continually improve myself and make the most of every opportunity.</p>
